# NgxDatatableDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Goal

Build an ngx-datatable using the data in `dataSource.ts`. Try loading it both synchronously and asynchronously. Try building columns by mapping keys to the `name` field on the columns, then try using a different `name` and mapping the key to the `prop` category. Use `ng-template` and `let-value` / `let-row` to have more flexibility with how the rows appear.
